.target_exist? stinkt
* we should rename .directory?, .file?, and potentially .exist? to avoid
  mistakes



On directories:
* Should we accept a symlink to a directory as existing target directory?
* Can we uninstall a directory?
* Can we have directory entries at all? (nb: empty directories!)


== High priority

* Uninstall (restore backup)
  => must remove backup?
* skipping files
  * how to mark a file as skipped?
	=> status file - yaml may be undesirable if gems cannot be installed
* "full" test for backups
* Should backup filenames really be unescaped?
* Should there be a single .coffle directory in source?
  => probably yes, so we can freely add things later
  => where would things like host class definitions go? need further structure?
  => are coffle source directories marked?
* Need a directory specification version, so we can add migrations
  => don't resort to "no spec => version 0" so we can recognize a missing spec
* What happens if a entry is no longer present? how to detect?
  => should be restored
  => ?


== Documentation

* Not copying directly to target: because it is unclear whether the file was
  installed by coffle
* not .build/.install: because the install operation is something else
* no unescaped names in processing directories: so we can use dotfiles for bookkeeping

On directories:
* If the target of a directory entry already exists, we use it and keep its contents.
** coffle directores are the same as other directories
** we want to keep, for example, .ssh/identity when installing .ssh/config

For now, we don't allow overwriting a file with a directory or vice versa.
We never make a backup of a directory (cannot be overwritten by a file
(refused) nor a directory (exists)).

Notes on backups of directories (in case we want to make them one day):
* Can we/do we have to distinguish a file backup in a directory from a
  directory backup?
* What about uninstalling directories that contain non-coffle entries?


On skipping:
* skipped means: not under coffle control
* act as if the entry didn't exist
* file ist not installed
* if it is already installed, uninstall it


=== Backups ===

Goals:
* install (even with --overwrite) followed by uninstall => same as before

Conclusions:
* The only reason to use multiple backups would be to allow the user to replace
  the the installed entries. However, this is probably neither easy nor simple.
  Therefore, we only use a single backup.
* If on "install" the backup is present and the target is "none" or "other", we
  may not keep the backup because after "uninstall", we would have restored an
  old backup. We also do not want to silently drop the backup after the user
  deletes the coffle link. Thus, we have to refuse.

dir       |file      |none    |*         ||            refuse           |dir blocked by file

Note:
* For directory entries, there is no overwriting install, since an existing
  directory will be treated as target=installed
* removed and replaced is only detected when there is a backup, which is never
  the case for directory entries.

== Low priority

* Special files, like ssh authorized keys: define keys, then invoke keys in
  host blocks:
  {{{
  <% ssh_define_keys do %>
    ssh-dss AAAAB3N...DjB/A martin@magrathea
    ssh-dss AAAAB3N...Y2KjL martin@damogran
  <% end %>

  <% host "sedna" do %>
    <%= ssh_keys "martin@magrathea", "martin@damogran" %>
  <% end %>
  }}}
* colored messages (rainbow gem) (?) (no gem requirements!)
* distinguish preprocessor by file extension
  * additional file name escaping required
  * Pro: different pp possible
  * Con: collision possible
  * Allow unprocessed files.
    * special case of different preprocessor (pro/con see there)
    * symlink directly (target->source instead of ->build)?
      * Pro: changes to file possible
      * Con: 
* Conditionals: host classes, user names
* Specify individual files on the command line
  * Update automessage command to rebuild only this file
* Message if file is not installed on build
* command clean, which cleans source/.build etc.
  * only if nothing is installed, override with --force
  * print a warning that the symlinks are now broken
* facilitate ignoring autogenerated files for revision control
  * move all coffle directories (.build, .install) to coffle?
* coffle init
* coffle import
* allow help message/coffle init even in non-source-directory
* add .coffle_target/ to the target, so we can do coffle commands from there
* better solution for installing a removed or replaced target:
  * switches to drop the old back or the target
  * operation drop_backup
* similarly, allow uninstalling of removed or replaced target with a switch
* implementation: there should be a DirectoryClass and a FileClass
* Handle error condition: backup directory is blocked by a file
* Handle error condition: when a directory was refused, all other entries in
  this directory must also be skipped (if the directory does not exist, we can
  probably assume that it was refused and skip its contents)
* tell the user what he did wrong and what to do on refuse
* allow "file should not exist" option (like skipping)
